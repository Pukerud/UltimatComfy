# UltimateComfy.sh Script

## Overview

`UltimateComfy.sh` is a comprehensive bash script designed to simplify the setup, management, and usage of ComfyUI through Docker. It provides a menu-driven interface for various operations, including:

-   **Initial Docker Setup:** Configures the necessary directory structure, generates a Dockerfile tailored for ComfyUI with NVIDIA GPU support, and builds the Docker image.
-   **Docker Image Management:** Allows users to rebuild or update the ComfyUI Docker image.
-   **Model Downloading:** Features a utility to download models from a specified server, either individually, by pre-defined packages, or all at once. It helps manage the ComfyUI models directory.
-   **Container Management:** Provides easy options to start and stop ComfyUI Docker containers. For multi-GPU setups, it manages separate containers per GPU.

The script aims to streamline the ComfyUI experience, especially for users who prefer Docker-based installations and need to manage multiple GPUs or model repositories.

## Key Features

-   **Automated Dockerfile Generation:** Creates a Dockerfile based on specified CUDA versions and sets up a Python virtual environment.
-   **Multi-GPU Support:** During the initial setup, users can specify the number of GPUs. The script then generates start/stop scripts that manage individual Docker containers per GPU, mapping them to different host ports.
-   **Flexible Model Management:** Connects to a model server (configurable) to browse and download models directly into the appropriate ComfyUI data directories.
-   **User-Friendly Menu:** Interactive menus guide the user through different operations.
-   **Path Auto-detection & Manual Override:** Attempts to find existing ComfyUI data paths but also allows manual path specification for model downloads.

## `--network host` Modification

The `docker run` command used to start the ComfyUI containers has been modified to include the `--network host` option.

**What it does:**
When `--network host` is used, the Docker container shares the network stack of the host machine. This means the container does not get its own IP address but uses the host's IP address directly. Any ports opened by applications inside the container will be directly accessible on the host machine's IP, without needing explicit port mapping (`-p host_port:container_port`).

**Implications:**
-   **Simplified Port Access:** The ComfyUI instance running inside the Docker container will be accessible at `http://localhost:8188` (or `http://<host_ip>:8188`), assuming 8188 is the default ComfyUI port. If multiple instances are run, they will need to listen on different ports within the container to avoid conflicts, as they all share the host's network. The script already handles assigning different host ports for multi-GPU setups by incrementing from 8188 (e.g., 8188, 8189, etc.). With `--network host`, the application inside the container *must* listen on these specific ports (e.g., main.py --port 8189). The current script's `CMD` in the Dockerfile is hardcoded to `python3 main.py --listen 0.0.0.0 --port 8188`. This means for multi-GPU setups with `--network host`, only the first instance (on 8188) will be directly accessible unless the `CMD` is made dynamic or the `docker run` command overrides the `CMD` to pass a different `--port` for each instance. *This is a potential issue to be aware of with the current script structure when using `--network host` for multiple containers.*
-   **Potential Port Conflicts:** Since the container uses the host's network directly, if any service on the host machine (or another container using `--network host`) is already using a port that ComfyUI tries to use, there will be a conflict.
-   **Performance:** May offer slight network performance improvements in some cases by reducing network address translation (NAT) overhead.
-   **Security:** Reduces network isolation between the container and the host. Use with caution, especially in multi-tenant environments or when running untrusted images.

**Note on Port Mapping (`-p`):**
The script currently retains the `-p ${host_port}:8188` option in the `docker run` command. When `--network host` is used, explicit port mappings with `-p` are generally ignored or unnecessary. However, their presence shouldn't typically cause issues.

## Usage

1.  **Make the script executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x UltimateComfy.sh
    ```
2.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    ./UltimateComfy.sh
    ```
3.  **Follow the on-screen menu options:**
    *   **Option 1 (FÃ¸rstegangs oppsett/Installer ComfyUI i Docker):** This should be your first step if you haven't set up ComfyUI with this script before. It will:
        *   Ask for the number of GPUs.
        *   Create necessary directories under `$HOME/comfyui_unified_setup`.
        *   Generate a `Dockerfile` in `$HOME/comfyui_unified_setup/docker_config`.
        *   Build the Docker image named `comfyui-app`.
        *   Generate `start_comfyui.sh` and `stop_comfyui.sh` scripts in `$HOME/comfyui_unified_setup/scripts/`. These scripts will include the `--network host` setting.
    *   **Option 2 (Bygg/Oppdater ComfyUI Docker Image):** Use this to rebuild the Docker image if you've modified the Dockerfile or want to update ComfyUI.
    *   **Option 3 (Last ned/Administrer Modeller):** Access the model downloader utility. You'll need to configure the ComfyUI data path if not automatically detected or set by Option 1.
    *   **Option 4 (Start ComfyUI Docker Container(e)):** Runs the generated `start_comfyui.sh` script to start the container(s).
    *   **Option 5 (Stopp ComfyUI Docker Container(e)):** Runs the generated `stop_comfyui.sh` script to stop and remove the container(s).
    *   **Option 6 (Avslutt):** Exits the script.

## Script Variables and Configuration

The script uses several global variables for paths and settings, defined at the beginning of the file. These can be modified if needed:

-   `BASE_DOCKER_SETUP_DIR`: Default `$HOME/comfyui_unified_setup`. Base directory for all generated files and data.
-   `COMFYUI_IMAGE_NAME`: Default `comfyui-app`. Name of the Docker image to be built.
-   `DOCKER_CUDA_DEVEL_TAG`: CUDA version for the builder stage in the Dockerfile.
-   `MD_SERVER_BASE_URL` and `MD_PACKAGES_JSON_URL`: URLs for the model downloader.

## Important Considerations

-   **Docker and NVIDIA Docker:** Ensure Docker is installed and configured correctly to work with NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., `nvidia-container-toolkit` is installed).
-   **Rootless Docker:** The script uses `docker` commands directly. If you are running Docker in rootless mode, ensure your user has the necessary permissions.
-   **Model Storage:** Models are stored in the `comfyui_data/models` subdirectory within your `BASE_DOCKER_SETUP_DIR`. Ensure you have sufficient disk space.
-   **Multi-GPU with `--network host`:** As noted in the "Implications" section for `--network host`, the current Dockerfile `CMD` hardcodes the ComfyUI listening port to 8188. For multiple GPU instances to be accessible when using `--network host`, each container would need to be started with a different `--port` argument to `main.py`. The `start_comfyui.sh` script generated by `UltimateComfy.sh` *does* map different host ports (`-p 8188:8188`, `-p 8189:8188`, etc.), but with `--network host`, the internal application port must also change. This means the `-p` option becomes less relevant, and the focus shifts to ensuring the `main.py` command inside each container uses a unique port corresponding to what you expect on the host. The current script does not dynamically adjust the `CMD` for `main.py` for different GPU instances.

This script provides a powerful way to manage ComfyUI, but always review scripts from the internet before running them, especially those that perform system operations like Docker image building and container management.
